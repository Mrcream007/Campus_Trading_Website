                        <p>Campus Trade-In is an application which helps students of Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen,
                            to buy
                            and items right on campus. The platform makes it easier for students to access essential
                            items
                            without having to break the bank or going far in terms of location. It also helps to reduce
                            waste
                            and promote the re-use of items. Through this, we intend to make a difference, solve a major
                            problem
                            through technology and improve students’ experiences while on campus. </p>
                        <p>This application enables students of Robert Gordon University to buy and sell items, such as
                            textbooks, electronics, and furniture on campus. It includes an escrow function to ensure
                            that both
                            trading parties are protected during the transaction</p>
                        <p>When a student wants to sell an item, they can post it on the application and set a price.
                            When
                            another student wants to buy the item, they can make an offer to the seller. Once the seller
                            accepts
                            the offer, the platform holds the payment in escrow until the item is received and verified
                            by the
                            buyer.</p>
                        <p>Once the buyer confirms that they have received the item, the platform releases the payment
                            to the
                            seller. Additionally, it could have a rating system, where buyers and sellers can rate each
                            other
                            based on their experience with the transaction.</p>
                        <p>This way, users can see which sellers are reliable and trustworthy. This platform could also
                            have a
                            feature where students can search for items by keywords, location, price range, and other
                            criteria
                            to make it easy for them to find the items they want.</p>
